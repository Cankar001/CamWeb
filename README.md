# CamWeb

CamWeb is a web application, that listens to the same path, 
where the CamServer stores its recordings. It contains a javascript player, which is able to read an unfinished video file and display it in the browser.

The CamServer application can keep writing 
into the video file, while the web application can 
display all current frames in the browser in the same time.

In this way we create an illusion of a live stream playing in the browser.
